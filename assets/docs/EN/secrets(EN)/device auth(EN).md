In this case, I will use the “Jules” bot, but you can use any other bot that allows you to create device auths.
- Join the [Jules Bot] server(https://discord.gg/jules)
- Search for the Jules bot and send it a message saying /login
- Once logged in send /deviceauth
- The bot will return three codes: Device ID, Account ID and Secret.
- Simply place each one in the corresponding Replit secret.
