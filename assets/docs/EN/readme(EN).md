This is a bot for Fortnite intended to be run on [Replit](https://replit.com/), but it also works locally. Below, I explain how to use it:

## Installation
- Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and log in (or create an account if you don't have one).
 
- Click on “Import from Github”.

- In the window that appears, select “From URL”, paste the link to this repository and click “Import from Github”.

- Once you are inside, open the “Secrets” tab in the “Tools” section.

- Add the following [secrets](secrets(EN)/secrets(EN).md)
 

- And that would be it! You can also go into the config.json file to change things like the bot's skin, the status...
